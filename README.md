# oopProjectGame
This is an C++ OOP project - a simple simulation game of raising a child.

----- Introduction -----
The game lasts for a year.
On each Month's first day, the player can
(1) Buy things for the kid.
(2) Plan the kid's work for this month.

In short, there are 12 rounds before the ending.
The kid's moral bar will decide the ending.

----- Monthly Expense -----
The kid needs food to survive.
If there's no money to buy food for the month, it's game over.
Therefore, working is essential.

----- Emotion Bar -----
Keep an eye on the kid's emotion bar.
If it's too low, the kid will refuse to work.
You can buy gifts for the kid to be happier.
Or, you can let the kid rest for this month.
